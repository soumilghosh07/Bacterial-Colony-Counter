# ResNet Model for Bacterial Colony Count Prediction

This project implements a Residual Neural Network (ResNet) for predicting the colony count of bacterial colonies in images. The ResNet architecture is well-suited for this regression task due to its ability to handle complex data and learn deep representations effectively.

## Introduction

Bacterial colony counting is an essential task in microbiology laboratories for various applications, including disease diagnosis and drug development. This project aims to predict the colony count in images using a deep learning approach, specifically leveraging the ResNet architecture.

## Installation

To run the ResNet model for bacterial colony count prediction, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Python Installation:** Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. **Download Dataset:** Obtain the dataset containing images of bacterial colonies and their corresponding colony counts.

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation:** Prepare the dataset containing images of bacterial colonies and their associated colony counts.
2. **Model Training:** Train the ResNet model using the provided training data.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance on a validation set to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.
4. **Prediction:** Use the trained ResNet model to predict the colony count in new images.

## Model Architecture

The ResNet model consists of residual blocks, which enable the training of very deep neural networks without suffering from vanishing gradient problems. Each residual block contains convolutional layers with shortcut connections, allowing the model to learn residual mappings.

## File Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `colonydetector.ipynb`: Python notebook script implementing the ResNet model for colony count prediction.
- `README.md`: Markdown file containing detailed instructions and explanations.

## Experiment Details

The experiment consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Images of bacterial colonies are loaded from the dataset, along with their corresponding colony counts.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Images are resized and normalized to prepare them for input to the ResNet model.
3. **Model Training:** The ResNet model is trained using the training data with colony count labels.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model's performance is evaluated on a validation set to measure its accuracy and loss.
5. **Prediction:** The trained model is used to predict colony counts in new images.

## Results

The results of the experiment include:

- **Training Loss and Metrics:** Loss and evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error) are monitored during training to assess model performance.
- **Validation Performance:** Performance metrics on the validation set provide insights into the model's generalization ability.
- **Test Results:** Final test results, including loss and Mean Absolute Error, indicate the model's performance on unseen data.
